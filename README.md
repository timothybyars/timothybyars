## Timothy Byars
### Technical Writer and Curriculum Developer
I am an editor, technical writer, and curriculum developer with over 20 years of experience writing, editing, and developing content. One of my key strengths is my expertise in program management. I have a proven track record of managing complex projects, ensuring successful delivery of learning programs from design to implementation. I have planned, designed, and directed the creation of a 10-course, 30-credit master’s program, and I’ve developed multiple individual courses for other post-secondary schools, as well. I have experience and skill understanding and conveying complex subjects (in the software and healthcare industries) and my editorial and curriculum design skills have enabled me to create impactful learning experiences that develop essential skills, capabilities, and knowledge in employees and leaders. <br/>

I’ve worked in large corporations and in start-ups and I have collaborated with teams of various disciplines, including creatives, managers, and engineers. I have used scores of software tools during my career (including multiple learning management systems, eLearning tools, and markup languages) and can ascend the learning curve very quickly when learning new tools. I’ve worked remotely for 20 years and managed two start-up businesses. I’m highly organized and manage my time effectively. <br/>

More recently, I’ve been developing and delivering educational and training solutions for healthcare professionals. You can review some of my recent lectures and slide deck design examples on the [Radicle Health YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@radiclehealth).
